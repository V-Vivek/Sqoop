# Sqoop Workflow
- Sqoop is a tool used to import/export data between Hadoop ecosystem and relational databases such as MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.

## It follows a workflow which is as follows:

- Sqoop client receives a request to import or export data from the user.
- Sqoop then generates a MapReduce job and submits it to the Hadoop cluster. This job is responsible for transferring data between Hadoop and the database.
- The MapReduce job executes in the cluster and transfers data in parallel.
- During the data transfer, Sqoop records the progress of the job and sends periodic updates to the client.
- Once the job is completed, Sqoop verifies the results and updates the status to the client.
- If the data import/export was successful, Sqoop stores the data in HDFS or the database as specified by the user.
- Finally, Sqoop cleans up temporary files and directories used during the import/export process.

- In summary, the Sqoop workflow involves generating and submitting a MapReduce job to transfer data between Hadoop and a database, monitoring the progress of the job and storing the results in the desired location.
